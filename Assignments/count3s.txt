Program Goal:
The goal of the Count3s program is to open a binary file and read all the binary code that otherwise translates to the integer 3 in human read language. 


Design Statement:
The program checks the pre-processor directives, initiates the main function, creates a filestream, opens the file and reads the data and prints to the console. 


Implementation:
After initiating the main function, declaring variables and creating a file stream. 
1. It creates an inbound stream object
2. Opens the file in the stream
3. Checks the file for threes in binary format
4. Converts the binary 3 to integer
5. Loops through the end of the file and counts all the 3s.
6. Displays the number of 3s which is saved in the variable.
