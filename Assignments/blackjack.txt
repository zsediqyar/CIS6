Design Goal Statement:
This program is designed to play Blackjack with the user and generate random cards to complete the count. It will randomly generate numbers and will determine the win/lost/bust/blackjack status based on the sum of the randomly generated numbers.



Organization Design Statement:
The program uses certain new libraries and headers. We include the headers, then initiate the namespace standard, then main function, afterward declare constant variables and also a random number generator which takes the unix time from the system. It does math operations on numbers and then gives the user response based on the total of cards.


Implementation Discussion:
The below are the steps in the implementation.
- including the libraries/pre-proc. directices
- using namespace standard
- initiating the main function
- declaring the variables
- initiating the random number generator which is seeded from the system time in unix format.
- roll cards and display them along with the sum of it to the user
- ask if the user wants another card and loop through this question until the cap is reached
- take the new card and add it to the total
- keep asking for cards until certain threshold is reached
- respond to user based on the final total
- ask if the user wants to replay
- based on users reply either use the defined GOTO or exit the program
