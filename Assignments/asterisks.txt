Design Goal Statement:
The program is intended to run and promptly ask the user if he/she wants to print a certain number of asterisks in the console. The program will then print the amount of asterisks based on the user's input and will continue to ask the user until he/she responds no, and then it exits.



Organization Design Statement:
The program contains the headers, the main function inside which are three variables which asks for number of asterisks, the user response if he/she wants to play again and holds the * character. The program also has a GOTO which restarts the question session based on the user's reply. 


Implementation Discussion:
The below are the steps in the implementation.
- including the libraries/pre-proc. directices
- using namespace standard
- initiating the main function
- declaring the variables
- initiate a goto
- asking the user for an input number
- loop through the object and print the same number of * user asked
- ask the user if he wants to replay
- based on his response do certain actions and determine the user's response by if conditionals.
